# Vitae
... is a feature-rich blog theme for Hugo that **focuses on your content**.

## :mega: Version 3.0 is finally released!

I've finally finished the development of version 3.0 and this is the last and
final version of Vitae. From now on only bugs will be fixed and if necessary
the program code will be refactored.

**!Since version 3.0, the default branch is MAIN and no longer MASTER!**
