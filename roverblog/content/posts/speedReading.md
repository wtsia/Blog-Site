1. Pointer
    - follows the word
    - used to encourage a faster reading rate beyond what is comfortable
    - do not go all the way to the peripheral word, your eyes will catch them
2. Ritual
    - put yourself into a mind-space that is conducive to learning
    - avoid distractions
3. Skip Parts
    - if you already know a story/topic, or are sure you won't learn anything new, then skip it. i.e. Pavlovian Dogs
    - skip ahead to the point of such a story
    - Skip acknowledgements
4. Remove Subvocalization
    - There is no need to say what you're reading in your head

## Extras
>How to Remember: **Summarize in your own words**. Apply the Feynman Technique. 
- The Feynman Technique is a method of learning that unleashes your potential and forces you to develop a deep understanding. Richard Feynman was a Nobel prize-winning physicist. His real superpower, however, was his ability to explain complicated subjects to others in simple terms.
