# **API Design**
## Introduction
API means Application Programming Interface.

# APIs: Digital Enablers
APIs enable many tools within an enterprise:
- Scalability for increased business
- Ecosystem for developers
- Accessibility to customers
- Information gathering

## Business Benefits
- New Revenue (Google Maps, Reddit--2023)
- Reach and Retention (npr)
- Faster Partnerships (Kayak)
- Mobile and Omnichannel (Capital One, Facebook, Amazon, mobile apps)
- Interaction Analysis (Mastercard)
- Outsourced Innovation (Netflix)
- Self-Service Integration (Amazon)
- Organizational Agility ("API First")

## Digital Feedback Loop
Business Goals -> Digital Reach -> Business Results -> Data-drive Insights -> Business Goals

## Case Studies
### Amazon
>Amazon's development of APIs in 2001-2002 connected the Amazon organization via web services. With good API documentation, the use of APIs in Amazon allowed for expansion towards infrastructure provisioning services--going from book retailer to AWS. Seamless switching from website to mobile.

### Disney
>Disney's use of a band is an IoT device that enabled an Omnichannel method to access keys, rides, etc. This allowed not only widespread usage, but also data-drive approaches to problems.

### Summary:
Define APIs. Understand Digital Feedback Loop. Business benefits, and API value in real life.

# API360 Model
- Alignment & Usefulness
  - Create API Strategy (Key Deliverables: **Roadmap, Organization, Business**)
- Engagement & Usability
  - Marketing APIs (Key Deliverables: **Dev Program, API/DX Design Principles, API Consumer Toolkits, Education**)
    - Marketing, Engagement, Ease of Use, Tools required
- Scalability & Evolvability (Key Deliverables: **Architecture Guidelines, API Lifecycle, Roadmaps, Skills Training**)
  - Future-proof + Appropriate Constraints, Optimized Usage > Standardization
  - *Runtime? Version? Factors affecting design time scalability? Trends? Constraints? Leveraging current assets?*
- Manageability & Security (Key Policies: **Analytics/Monitoring, Identity/Security, Infrastructure/Operations, Mangement Platform**)
  - Good Tracking, Access Management
  - *Metrics? Control? Privacy? Threats?*
  - Policies: Analytics/Monitoring, Identity/Security, Infrastructure/Operations, Mangement Platform
