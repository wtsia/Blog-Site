# Introduction

## Interpreting Syntax
```
const ageStr = age > 5 ? 'old' : 'young' 
// if age > 5 is true, 'old', else 'young'
```
# Async-await
Express asynchronous code in synchronous format
```
const sumRandomAsyncNums = async() => {
    const first = await random();
    const second = await random();
    const third = await random();
}
```

# Debugging
**Computer Property Names**: Console logging may be input into an object with css styling:
```
console.log('%c Title', 'color: orange');
console.log({ var1, var2, var3});

// track time
console.time('name_given');
// run logic
console.timeEnd('name_given');

// find origination of console log
const deleteMe = () => console.trace('bye bye database');
```

# Destructuring
When a function takes in an object, we can make readability simpler by passing in the object's properties into the function:
```
function feed(object) {
    const { prop1, prop2, prop3 } = object;
    return `This sentence: ${prop1} ${prop2} ${prop3}`;
}
```

# Template literals
You can interpolate instead of concatenating values together
```
const { prop1, prop2, prop3 } = object;

newVar = `Backticks are needed to ${prop1} ${prop2} ${prop3}`;
console.log(newVar);
```

# Review

## JavaScript: Introduction

- **Object:** In JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that can contain key-value pairs. Objects are used to represent and organize data in a structured way.

- **Method:** A method is a function that is associated with an object. It can be invoked using dot notation, like `object.method()`.

- **document.write:** `document.write` is a method in JavaScript that allows you to write HTML content directly to the document. While it's a simple way to add content, it's not commonly used in modern web development due to potential issues with document structure and performance.

- **var:** `var` is a keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript. In modern JavaScript, it's often replaced with `let` or `const`.

- **alert:** `alert` is a method that displays a dialog box with a specified message and an OK button. It is often used for debugging or showing information to the user.

- **document.forms["myform"].elements["num"].value:** This expression accesses the value of an input element with the name "num" inside a form with the name "myform".

- **elementById:** `getElementById` is a method used to get a reference to an HTML element based on its unique ID.

- **innerHTML:** `innerHTML` is a property that represents the HTML content within an element. It can be used to retrieve or modify the content of an element.

- **Equality and Relational Operators:** Equality operators (`==` and `===`) are used to compare values for equality. Relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) are used to compare values in terms of their order.

- **parseInt:** `parseInt` is a function used to parse a string and convert it into an integer.

- **parseFloat:** `parseFloat` is a function used to parse a string and convert it into a floating-point number.

- **toFixed():** `toFixed` is a method that rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places and returns the result as a string.

- **if statement:** The `if` statement is a control flow statement that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

## JavaScript: Control Statements

- **if...else statement:** The `if...else` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

- **Nested if:** A nested `if` statement is an `if` statement inside another `if` or `else` block.

- **while statement:** The `while` statement creates a loop that executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

- **Assignment Operators (e.g., +=):** Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. `+=` is an example that adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

- **Increment Operators (e.g., ++):** Increment operators are used to increase the value of a variable. `++` adds 1 to the variable.

- **switch statement:** The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

- **break:** `break` is used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely.

- **default:** `default` is used in a switch statement as a default case when no other case matches.

- **continue:** `continue` is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and continue with the next iteration.

- **for statement:** The `for` statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions: initialization, condition, and iteration.

- **Nested for statements:** A nested `for` statement is a `for` statement inside another `for` loop.

- **Logical Operators (e.g., ||):** Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. `||` represents the logical OR.

- **isNaN:** `isNaN` is a function that checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number).

## JavaScript: Functions

- **Function Definition Syntax:** Functions are defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters in parentheses, and a block of code in curly braces.

- **Function Call:** A function is called or invoked by using its name followed by parentheses, containing any required arguments.

- **Function Argument:** A function argument is a value provided to a function when it is called.

- **Math.pow:** `Math.pow` is a method that returns the base to the power of the exponent.

- **Math.round:** `Math.round` is a method that rounds a number to the nearest integer.

- **Math.floor:** `Math.floor` is a method that rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

- **Math.random:** `Math.random` is a method that generates a pseudo-random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

- **Local and Global Variables:** Local variables are declared within a function and have local scope, while global variables are declared outside any function and have global scope.

## JavaScript: Arrays

- **Definition of Array:** An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key.

- **Subscript:** A subscript is the index used to access individual elements in an array.

- **Defining a New Array:** Arrays can be defined using square brackets and can contain elements of any data type.

- **Array Initialization:** Array initialization is the process of assigning values to the elements of an array during its creation.

- **2-Dimensional Array:** A 2-dimensional array is an array of arrays, forming a matrix-like structure.

- **Looping Through an Array Using the for Statement:** The `for` statement can be used to iterate through the elements of an array.

- **Pull-Down Menu:** A pull-down menu, often implemented using a `<select>` element, allows users to choose from a list of options.

- **Form Field Validation:** Arrays can be used to store and validate form field values efficiently.

## JavaScript: Objects

- **string.substring:** `substring` is a method that returns a portion of a string between two specified indices.

- **indexOf:** `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

- **Date Methods:** JavaScript provides methods to work with dates, including creating Date objects and accessing various components like day, month, year, etc.

- **Math.floor:** `Math.floor` is a method that rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

- **Math.round:** `Math.round` is a method that rounds a number to the nearest integer.

- **Regular Expressions:** Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.

- **window.open:** `window.open` is a method that opens a new browser window or tab.

## JavaScript: Object Model and Misc jQuery
