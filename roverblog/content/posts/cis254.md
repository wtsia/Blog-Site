Student Learning Outcomes (SLO): 
1. Analyze and explain the behavior of programs involving the **fundamental program constructs**.
2. Write short programs that use the fundamental program constructs including **standard conditional** and **iterative control structures**.
3. Identify and correct syntax and logic errors in short programs.
4. Write short programs using *arrays*.
5. Design and implement a *class* based on *attributes* and *behaviors* of **objects**.
6. Construct objects using a *class* and activate methods on them.
7. Use **static** and **instance** members of a class properly.
8. Identify and describe **value**, **scope** and **lifetime** of a variable.
9. Describe the parameter passing **mechanisms** and **method overloading**.

> Keep these concepts in mind for testing. 

## Introduction
![Introduction to Java](/rover/img/ComputerScience/introJava.jpg)
- At its core level, computers are switches, and store information in bytes (8 bits).
  - memory stores information in binary (1 or 0, like a switch!)
  - instructions go to the processor, and turns executable (in binary `1101 1011 ...`), then an assembler creates the high level instruction.
    - Java takes the high level language, runs it through a compiler, which takes it through a virtual processor that turns it executable (bytecode), and finally executes in the Virtual Machine within a processor
      - Java this method allows it to execute on different processors, its design which is reflected in the intention of creating desktop applications.
