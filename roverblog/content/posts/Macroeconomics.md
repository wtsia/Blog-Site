#### Quantity Theory of Money
let $m$ = money, $v$ = money velocity, $p$ = price levels for goods and services, and for $y$ = real goods and services. Then: 

$m * v = p * y$

Is it relevant? Here are modern contributions: 

This mathematical
framework took two alternative forms, namely

(1) Irving Fisherâ€™s famous equation of exchange,

$MV = PT$

where $M$ is the stock of money, $V$ is velocity of circulation, $P$ is the price level, and $T$ is the physical volume of market transactions; and,

(2) the celebrated Cambridge cash balance equation,

$M = kPy$ 

where $M$ is the stock of money in circulation, $k$ is the desired cash balance ratio, i.e., the ratio of the nominal money supply to nominal income, $P$ is the price level of the national product, and $y$ is real national income or the national product valued at constant prices.
