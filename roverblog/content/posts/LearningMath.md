#### Before Class
- 5 minute review before class
    - Cover big points, i.e. big concepts 
    - Spaced Retrieval: pulling concepts back into memory to strengthen neural connections.
- Study Topics before class, preferably early in the day before class starts and right after you wake up (Dr. K)
- Previewing content, solidifying foundational concepts so you can focus on the time spent in class being more effective

#### Going to Class
- Being a stenographer is the worse possible thing to do
    - Do more previewing so active learning is more available in class!!
- Tricks:
    - Generate questions, write it down or circle a spot
    - Annotate notes with stars, circles, question marks to look back on these concepts

#### Post-Class Review
- Go over notes in class, and try to make sure you 100% understood that content
- Reframing notes in your own words solidify understanding serves heavily in retaining information
- More Questions? Always come up with at least 3 questions

##### Most Important
- PRACTICE!
    - Spent as much time as you can on this portion
- Concept Mapping!
    - Write out main ideas of a particular subject in a big map
    - Connecting ideas helps to strengthen understanding
