#### Before Class
- 5 minute review before class
    - Cover big points, i.e. big concepts 
    - Spaced Retrieval: pulling concepts back into memory to strengthen neural connections.
- Study Topics before class, preferably early in the day before class starts and right after you wake up (Dr. K)
- Previewing content, solidifying foundational concepts so you can focus on the time spent in class being more effective

#### Going to Class
- Being a stenographer is the worse possible thing to do
    - Do more previewing so active learning is more available in class!!
- Tricks:
    - Generate questions, write it down or circle a spot
    - Annotate notes with stars, circles, question marks to look back on these concepts

#### Post-Class Review
- Go over notes in class, and try to make sure you 100% understood that content
- Reframing notes in your own words solidify understanding serves heavily in retaining information
- More Questions? Always come up with at least 3 questions

##### Most Important
- PRACTICE!
    - Spent as much time as you can on this portion
- Concept Mapping!
    - Write out main ideas of a particular subject in a big map
    - Connecting ideas helps to strengthen understanding

#### Learning Effectively
1. Growth Mindset
    - A national experiment reveals where growth mindset improves achievement (Yeager, David S. et al)
    - Positive and Negative mindsets inhibit developing improvments in metrics
    - Fixed mindsets are bad!
2. Metacognition (Dr. Sandra McGuire)
    - When thinking about thinking/learning
    - Pausing and reflecting on whether you're learning effectively
    - self-assessment 
3. Simplify & Explain
    - Expressing this concept in a way you are able to handle, letting you take ownership of the information being passed through
    - shows a deeper understanding of material
    - Feinmann technique
4. Questions
    - Ask a lot of questions!
        - Come up with a list of good questions about that video
        - Questions that allow more deeper understanding
5. Intrinsic Motivation
    - Internal motivation
        - Applied concepts, while nice, should also have intrinsic joy in concepts within mathematics

Example: Chess
- Growth Mindset: Improving is only upward!
- Metacognition: What parts of learning chess was effective/not?
- Simplify/Explain: Distill general principles of moves
- Questions: Why did they move this way? Why is this heuristic true?
- Intrinsic Motivation: want to do it for the game

#### Succeeding in Online Courses
- Practice math!
- Be as socially interactive as possible
- Do active assessment of your own learning capabilites, take record of what you understand and don't
- Growth Mindset
- Work Hard, think of being a student like a profession
