Disclaimer: Listing these tools are not condoning the legality of use for such tools.

1. Research Tools
- Google Scholar
    - General search compiling from different sources. The preferred method to PubMed Search.
- PubMed Search
    - A source directly from an online medical research aggregator 
- Sci-Hub
    - A search engine for unaccessible medical research behind a paywall
- The Cochrane Library
    - An aggregator of meta-analyses, and useful for comparing between national output. Top-end standard of research. 

2. Concepts
- Hierarchy of evidence (Descending):
    1. Meta-Analyses
    2. Clinical
    3. Observation
    4. Mechanistic
- Study Anatomy
    - Abstract: Summary of findings
    - Introduction: Background of the field, how research fits in
    - Methods: Experimental Details
    - Results: Meat of the paper
    - Discussion: Implications, limitations, future work
    - Conclusion, Acknowledgements, References: Self explanatory
- Pitfalls:
    - Lack of proper expertise. 
        1. Drs know everything
            - Drs do not know everything, but stay receptive of expert opinion
        2. Drs know nothing
            - reading blog articles do not equate to scientific research as information is passed through multiple cognitive filters. 
        3. Shopping for Advice
            - Leaves you vulnerable to confirmation bias
        4. Clinging to the 1st idea
            - In order to avoid being wrong, people stay wrong
        5. Isolation
            - Avoiding interacting with experts can lead to longer time spent finding profound insights. Use communication.
    - Red Flags
        1. Conspiracy Theories
        2. Resistance/Resentment for challenging core beliefs
            - Science invites scrutiny
