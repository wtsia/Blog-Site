## Review

### Vectors & Vector Addition
![Vector Review](/rover/img/Physics/ReviewVector.jpg)


### Charge Density
$\rho = m/V = kg/m^3$

$\sigma = m/A = kg/m^2$

$\lambda = m/L = kg/m$

we can modify the equations so that mass ($m$) is Coulombs ($C$)

UNIT 1

You should know:

- Memorize the meanings of the common metric prefixes (p, n, µ, m, c, k, M)
-The steps outlined in the problem solving guide.
- The meanings of key terms.
- The electron/proton model of electric charge, and how it explains the behavior of electric charges qualitatively.
- How to use Coulomb’s Law to calculate electric forces and field between point charges, including groups of many point charges.
- How to find the electric force or field created by a continuous charge distribution using integration.
- The meaning of the electric field.

also know the following material from previous sections:

- The electron/proton model of electric charge, and how it explains the behavior of electric charges qualitatively.
- How to use Coulomb’s Law to calculate electric forces and field between point charges, including groups of many point charges.
- How to find the electric force or field created by a continuous charge distribution using integration.
  - 
- The meaning of the electric field
  - represented by electric field lines, which is a representation of forces applied by the interaction of charges
