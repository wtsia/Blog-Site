## Matlab vs Octave
- in Matlab, `%%` is used to comment out code. However, in Octave, its `##`

## Computational Methods: Octave/Matlab
Background
- compiled languages vs interpreted
  - compiled require a programs code to be compiled before execution (specific to the processor)
  - interpreted means an interpreter (more applicable across systems) will read high-level statements and execute the operation so on and so forth
    - MATLAB is an interpreter!
  - *whitespace* is not interpreted in Matlab
  #### Common Commands:
  ```
  clc: clears command window
  clear: clears all vars
  diary: records command terminal content 
  exit: exits session
  who: prints all vars in workspace
  whos: ^^ but also prints size, bytes, class, etc
  ctrl-c: interrupts program
  ```
- `format long/short`: 15 digits and 4 digits respectively
- `format compact/loose`: single and double spacing

### Binary
- 0000, 0001, 0010...
- signed vs unsigned: 
  - unsigned represent non-negative values (1111 = 15)
  - signed uses leftmost bit to represent positive of negative
- Binary has an additive property:
```
    0 1 1 1
  + 0 1 1 0
  = 1 1 0 1
```
- overflow: when a binary operator is too large to fit in bits. i.e. 10000 > 1111 + 0001

### Variables and Assignments
- variable is a place for a programmer to store data in memory
- variables take on the value of its most recently assigned value. They can change!

### Identifiers 

| Keywords |          |            |        |
|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| break    | else     | global     | return |
| case     | elseif   | if         | spmd   |
| catch    | end      | otherwise  | switch |
| classdef | for      | parfor     | try    |
| continue | function | persistent | while  |

- The above **CANNOT** be used as identifiers
  - as well as predefined mathematical constants, or functions
  - Invalid: `$`,`-`, starting with numbers, 
- make meaningful names for variables
- Good Practice: `camelCase` with no `under_Scores`

### Numeric Variables
- 1 byte = 8 bits
- Scientific Notation: $3.14 * 10^n$
  - binary normalized scientific notation: 
$$
1.f * 2^{exponent}
$$
- i.e. $1.010 * 2^5$
- *mantissa*: the part of a floating-point number that represents the significant digits of that number, and that is multiplied by the base raised to the exponent to give the actual value of the number.
- **double precision**, consisting of:

  - 1 bit (bit 63) for the sign. 0 indicates the number is positive. 1 indicates the number is negative.
  - 11 bits (bits 62 to 52) for the exponent.
  - 52 bits (bits 51 to 0) for the fractional part of the mantissa; the whole part of the mantissa is always 1 and thus is not explicitly stored.
  - range: $10^{308}$
- The standard also defines a 32-bit floating-point representation known as **single precision**, with 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23 bits for the fractional part
  - range: $10^{38}$
- `realmax` = $supernum$
- `realmin` = $minimum$
- MATLAB Defaults:
  - creates real and double-precision numbers

### Numeric Expressions
- do not omit th *
- minus used as a negative is known as unary minus
### Precedence:
  ```
  P(arenthesis ())
  E(xponents ^)
  M(inus signs, or ~ negations)
  M(ultiplication * or)
  D(ivision /)
  A(ddition + or)
  S(ubtraction -)
  R(elational operators ==,<,>,<=,>=)
  &
  |
  &&
  ||
  ```
- and left to right
- continuation (`...`):
```
>> x1 = (1/2)^1+(1/2)^2+(1/2)^3+...
           (1/2)^4+(1/2)^5+(1/2)^6+...
           (1/2)^7+(1/2)^8+(1/2)^9;
```
- Good practice is to refrain from using very long expressions, instead breaking the expression into subexpressions by using intermediate variables, which makes the program more readable and easier to troubleshoot.
  - reduce clutter
- The value Inf, meaning infinity, arises either when a nonzero value is divided by zero or when a mathematical expression results in an overflow. Overflow occurs when the result of a expression exceeds the maximum value that can be stored within a variable.
- The value NaN, meaning not-a-number, is generated by trying to evaluate expressions that do not have well defined mathematical values. For example, the expressions 0/0 and Inf-Inf evaluate to NaN.

### String Scalars
- A **string scalar** stores text in a variable that has a class string.
- The ASCII standard is a commonly-used way of encoding characters using bits. For example, the 8-bit ASCII encoding of the character "s" is 1110011, which is 115 in decimal. The statement myChar = "s"

### Logical Variables
- A logical value, also known as a Boolean value, can be only true (indicated by a non-zero number, typically 1) or false (indicated by the number 0)
  - Such variables only occupy one byte each, in contrast to the numerical variable num, which occupies 8 bytes
  - `xor(A, B)`: checks if truth value is the same

### Short-Circuit Evaluation
- short-circuits occur when the rest of the logical operator is not executed, hence 'short circuit'
- `&&`: 
  - 1st expression `true`, 2nd expression evaluated 
  - 1st value `false`, 2nd expression isn't
- `||`: 
  - 1st expression `true`, so 2nd expression isn't evaluated
  - 1st `false`, 2nd is evaluated

### Precendence
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *) have precedence over relational operators
- == has precedence over &

### Scripts

### Functions
- Matlab has reusable functions
- `ismembertol(<calculation>,<goal>,<range>)`

### Modular Arithmetic
```
num0 % num1
```
> This is equivalent to the remainder of $num0/num1$ 

### Numeric Data-types
- `double float` is the most common floating-point type
- A `double`'s *mantissa* is limited to 16 digits (due to the number of bits that represent the mantissa), but an int's range is about +/- 2 billion which means 10 digits.

```
linspace(<starting value>, <ending value>, <total partitions>)
logspace(<starting 10^n>, <ending 10^n>, <total partitions>)
```

Commonly-used formatting operators.
Operator	Prints	Description
%f
fixed-point	f is for fixed-point.
%d
integer	d is for decimal integer. The use of d is due to historical reasons, and is slightly misleading because a decimal number could have a fractional part. In MATLAB, %d means decimal integer which does not have a fraction.
%i
integer	i is for integer. This operator is identical to %d when formatting output.
%c
character	c is for character.
%s
string	s is for string.
```

```
Commonly-used special characters.
Special character	Description
\n
Prints a new line.
''
Two single quotation marks print a single quotation mark. Note that a single quotation mark alone would instead indicate the end of the format specification.
%%
Two percent characters print one percent character. Note that a single % character would instead indicate the start of a formatting operator like %f.
\\
Two backslash characters print one backslash character. Note that a single backslash character would instead indicate the start of a special character sequence like \n.
\t
Prints a tab.
```

```
Floating-point number formatting operators.
Operator	Description
%f
Fixed-point notation
%e
Scientific notation with lowercase e, as in 3.141593e+00
%g
Either %f or %e, whatever is shorter
%E
Scientific notation with capital E, as in 3.141593E+00
%G
Either %f or %E, whichever is shorter
```

```
Conversion specification	Description
-
Specifies left-justified display. Without this item, the default is right-justified.

fieldWidth
Number that specifies the minimum number of digits that will be displayed. If the actual number of digits is less, spaces are automatically inserted to reach the minimum. If not set, the number of digits corresponds to the default number digits used in the base workspace for the class of numeric variable (for more information, enter 'help format' on the command line).

precision
Number that specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.
```

```
### Indexing rows and Columns: Single Colon
MATLAB supports a single colon index to access all elements of a row or column. All of the third row can thus accessed as sampleMatrix(3, : ). Likewise, all of column 2 can be accessed as sampleMatrix( :, 2)


### Concatenation
- Good practice is to use concatenation to create 2D arrays from 1D arrays, rather than creating one large 2D array. As shown above, monthSpend is created by concatenating weekSpend 1d arrays, rather than as an initial large 2D array.

### Branching
- if-else
- switch-case: tests equality
- try-catch: handles errors
