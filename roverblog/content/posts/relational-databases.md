# Relational Databases: MySQL
an introduction to the relational model, relational algebra, and SQL. Also covers XML data including DTDs
and XML Schema for validation, and an introduction to the query and transformation languages XPath, 
XQuery, and XSLT. The course includes relational design principles based on dependencies and normal 
forms. Additional database topics introduced are indexes, views, transactions, authorization, integrity 
constraints, triggers, on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and emerging NoSQL (Not only SQL) 
databases for cloud and desktop computing.

## Outcomes:
1. Create and assure the quality of a suitable data model for a given application.
2. Use normalization to transform a relational schema into a set of normalized relations (3NF).
3. Use SQL for database creation, manipulation and control.
4. Employ data storage and indexing options and perform query optimization.
5. Perform basic database administration tasks.
6. Employ XML technologies to query, manipulate and transform data.
7. Develop NoSQL desktop and cloud database solutions.
