# Overview
5 Chapters, 20+ modules

# Security Principles:
## Information Assurance
### CIA Triad
Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability
- C: Access management (sensitivity)
- I: Accurate, consistent data (baseline and state)
- A: Timely + Reliable access (criticality)
>The CIA triad is the cornerstone of information security, and as a security professional you will use all its components—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—to protect the information in your charge. Think of it as a three-dimensional way of thinking. There are many different aspects to protecting information and the more you think about it, the more you realize how complex it can be.

### Authentication
- Knowledge, Token, or Characteristic

### Privacy
Laws to act in accordance with:
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

## Risk Management
**Risk assessment, analysis, mitigation, remediation and communication**. IT Risk $\subset$ Business Risk. Threat actors utilize threat vectors and stand at the opposing side to mitigating risk. **Probability** and **Impact** are important concepts in a subjective risk analysis.

### Methods of Risk Management
- Acceptance: Deeming something an "acceptable" risk 
- Transfer: i.e. Insurance Policy
- Avoidance: Desisting operations to "avoid"
- Mitigation: Preventative measures like controls, policies, procedures, hiring expertise
  
Risk may be presented with a risk matrix, a graph with an $x(+)$ and $y(+)$ axis, one corresponding to **likelihood** and the other axis corresponding to **impact**.

### Security Controls, Governance, Ethics
Security Controls are the physical (entry badge), technical (logical controls, computer implemented) and administrative mechanisms that act as safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and its information
- Policy: Sets guidelines/standards
- Procedure: Explicit sets of actions to undertake

#### Regulation and Laws
- (HIPAA, 1996) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act: must keep protected health information (PHI) secure, 1996.
- (GDPR, 2016) General Data Protection Regulation: EU provisions for personally identifiable information (PII) protections

#### Standards
- (ISO) International Organization for Standardization
- (NIST) National Institute of Standards and Technology: Dept. of Commerce, US Infosec standards. 
- (IETF) Internet Engineering Task Force: Body that regulates communication standards
- (IEEE) Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers: sets subject standards

# Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery, Incidence Response
## Business Continuity Plan
Components include: team members, procedures/checlists, notifications, guidence for managers, how/when, critical supply chain contacts.
- Red Book: "Red Book" typically refers to a comprehensive document or set of guidelines that outlines security policies, procedures, and best practices for a specific organization or system (often given to entities outside the facility)

## Disaster Recovery

## Incidence Response
