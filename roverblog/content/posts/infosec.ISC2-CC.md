# Security Principles:
## Information Assurance
### CIA Triad
Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability
- C: Access management (sensitivity)
- I: Accurate, consistent data (baseline and state)
- A: Timely + Reliable access (criticality)
>The CIA triad is the cornerstone of information security, and as a security professional you will use all its components—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—to protect the information in your charge. Think of it as a three-dimensional way of thinking. There are many different aspects to protecting information and the more you think about it, the more you realize how complex it can be.

### Authentication
- Knowledge, Token, or Characteristic

### Privacy
Laws to act in accordance with:
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

## Risk Management
**Risk assessment, analysis, mitigation, remediation and communication**. IT Risk $\subset$ Business Risk. Threat actors utilize threat vectors and stand at the opposing side to mitigating risk. **Probability** and **Impact** are important concepts in a subjective risk analysis.

### Methods of Risk Management
- Avoidance: Desisting operations to "avoid"
- Acceptance: Deeming something an "acceptable" risk 
- Mitigation: Preventative measures like controls, policies, procedures
- Transfer: i.e. Insurance Policy
