## Speed Reading
1. Pointer
    - follows the word
    - used to encourage a faster reading rate beyond what is comfortable
    - do not go all the way to the peripheral word, your eyes will catch them
2. Ritual
    - put yourself into a mind-space that is conducive to learning
    - avoid distractions
3. Skip Parts
    - if you already know a story/topic, or are sure you won't learn anything new, then skip it. i.e. Pavlovian Dogs
    - skip ahead to the point of such a story
    - Skip acknowledgements
4. Remove Subvocalization
    - There is no need to say what you're reading in your head

## Extras
>How to Remember: **Summarize in your own words**. Apply the Feynman Technique. 
- The Feynman Technique is a method of learning that unleashes your potential and forces you to develop a deep understanding. Richard Feynman was a Nobel prize-winning physicist. His real superpower, however, was his ability to explain complicated subjects to others in simple terms.

## Procrastination
1. Emotional Ratio
- Fear of failure or past events leaves people paralyzed to act
    
    Ways to address negative emotions:
    - shifting away from worrying--live one day at a time. Focus on the present
    - Think about other people or the greater good
    - Every time you have procrastination, collect negative thoughts and write them down and offload negative thoughts 
    - Boredom: Do not resist distraction, *embrace* the feeling of boredom

2. Friction and Momentum
- Taking action creates motivation
    - motivation is not needed for most activities. Use habits and routine
- Reduce friction to get started!
    - 2 day rule: do not procrastination beyond 2 days
- ex: (Goal) Read entire book, (Step) read one page per day

3. Plan to Procrastinate
- Fail to plan, plan to procrastinate
- Instead of focusing on a goal, find enjoyment in the process and learning
    - Trying to control outcomes leads to negative emotions
- "Goals are temporary" (Clear) $\rarr$ "Habits are persistent"
- 3-in-one Rule: 3 most important tasks for tomorrow should be planned for today (recommended at lunch time, star important task)
- 1-hour-rule: spend the 1st hour of the day dedicated to yourself

> Big 3: </br> 1) Manage emotions: procrastination = negative emotions > positive emotions. </br> 2) Build momentum: too much friction = procrastination. </br> 3) Prioritize Planning: not planning = planning to procrastinate </br> Summary: impede procrastination through habits, planning, and pre-emptive mental priming.
