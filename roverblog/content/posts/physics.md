## Basic Definitions


Density: $ρ = \frac{m}{V}$
- where $m$ is mass, and $V$ is volume
- often in units of $g/cm^3$ or $kg/m^3$
## Newtons Laws


## Boyle's law
Pressure and Volume of a gas are inversely related, represented by:
$$
P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2}
$$
where $P$ is pressure and $V$ is volume

## Bernoulli's Principle
For a horizontal flow an increase in velocity must be accompanied by a decrease in pressure

### Streamline Equation
$$
P + \frac{ρ}{2}v^2 + ρgh = constant
$$
Sum of the 3 terms remain constant. $P$ is static pressure, $\frac{ρ}{2}v^2$ is dynamic pressure, and $ρgh$ is the hydrostatic pressure.
- **Static Pressure**: $P$ is fluid pressure
- **Dynamic Pressure**: $ρ$ is density while $v$ is velocity
- **Hydrostatic Pressure**: $g$ is gravitational acceleration, while $h$ is elevation of the fluid, or heigh above a reference level.

Limitations:
- Deriving the equation assumes flow is laminar and steady, negligible shear forces due to viscosity, and density is constant due to being incompressible

### Methods of Derivation:
**Conservation of Energy**: Work done on a fluid increases its kinetic energy $W = \Delta KE$

**Newtons 2nd Law**: $F = ma$

### Incompressible Flow
A common form of Bernoulli's equation, valid at any arbitrary point along a streamline, is:
$$
{\displaystyle {\frac {v^{2}}{2}}+gz+{\frac {p}{\rho }}={\text{constant}}}	
$$

where:

- $v$ is the fluid flow speed at a point on a streamline,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $z$ is the elevation of the point above a reference plane, with the positive z-direction pointing upward – so in the direction opposite to the gravitational acceleration,
- $p$ is the pressure at the chosen point, and
- $ρ$ is the density of the fluid at all points in the fluid.
