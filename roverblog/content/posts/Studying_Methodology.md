# Best Methodology
1. Divide the object into three categories:
    - Source Material
    - Harder (skipped) Concepts
    - Notes
2. Read through the source material. If difficult material that takes 2+ minutes to understand appears, add that to the notes for harder concepts and continue onward to what you can understand.
3. Pause and reconsider the material you understand. Try to do a few things:
    - Project forward what the material might suggest
    - 
4. Once you reach the end, go back around to the harder concepts and see if you can understand them better knowing the surrounding, more easily understood content.
5.
