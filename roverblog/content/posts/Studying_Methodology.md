# Best Methodology
1. Divide the object into three categories:
    - Source Material
    - Harder (skipped) Concepts
    - Notes
2. Read through the source material. If difficult material that takes 2+ minutes to understand appears, or it seems like material that you feel you will just need to memorize, add that to the notes for harder concepts and continue onward to what you can understand.
3. Pause and reconsider the material you understand. Try to do a few things:
    - Project forward what the material might suggest
    - speed through simple words and slow down for complicated ideas
    - use sub-vocalizing for said complicated ideas
    - take those pauses!
4. Once you reach the end, go back around to the harder concepts and see if you can understand them better knowing the surrounding, more easily understood content.
5. If you still cannot understand the material, then add them to flash cards.

# Problem of Active Recall and Spaced Repetition

- Studying ~= learning!
- Cognitive Load means you are engaging high-efficiency pathways
    - i.e. feeling confused
- Correct encoding is difficult!
    - Too much cognitive load can mean low encoding
- Passive learning: obtaining information from low load, low encoding, and low learning
- Personal note: perhaps when it feels like your brain is actually contracting like a muscle (blood pressure changes?)
- Desirable Difficulty: brain is only being used effectively when using a suitable amount of discomfort 
- Retrieval Techniques are easier to learn
### Why does Active Recall Work?
- it mitigates the functional forgetting that occurs with normal learning, such that the forgetting curve gets more steep
