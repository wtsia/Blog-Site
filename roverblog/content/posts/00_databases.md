## [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite)
SQLite (/ˌɛsˌkjuːˌɛlˈaɪt/,[4][5] /ˈsiːkwəˌlaɪt/[6]) is a database engine written in the C programming language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library that software developers embed in their apps. As such, it belongs to the family of embedded databases.
