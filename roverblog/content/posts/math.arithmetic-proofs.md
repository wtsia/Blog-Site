## Squared Numbers Equality Proof
Prove $\forall n,a\in\natnums$, 
$$
n^2 = (n+a)(n-a) + a^2 
$$ 
### Proof:
We can simply show the equalty holds true given some manipulation:
$$
(n+a)(n-a) + a^2
\\\\ = n^2 -an +an -a^2 + a^2
\\\\ = n^2
\\\\ \square
$$

## Geometric Series Proof
Consider a series represented as such:
$$
\Sigma_{n=0}^{n} ar^n = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ...
$$
The formula is:
$$
S_n = a_1(\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r})
$$

Proof:
$$

### Context
