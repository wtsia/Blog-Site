SLO:
1. Use MATLAB as a *computational tool* to solve problems in engineering, mathematics, and the sciences.
2. Use MATLAB as a *plotting and visualization tool*.
3. Design, implement, and test computer programs to achieve stated objectives.
4. Begin to use standard data structures.
5. Working from a verbal or equation-based description, set up systems of simultaneous equations and use MATLAB to determine existence and uniqueness of solution and solve.
6. Working from a verbal or equation-based description, use appropriate numerical techniques for differentiation, integration, and solution of differential equations.
7. Apply numeric techniques and computer simulations to analyze and solve problems in engineering, mathematics, and the sciences.
