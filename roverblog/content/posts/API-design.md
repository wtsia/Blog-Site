# **API Design**
## Introduction
API means Application Programming Interface.

# APIs: Digital Enablers
APIs enable many tools within an enterprise:
- Scalability for increased business
- Ecosystem for developers
- Accessibilty to customers
- Information gathering

## Business Benefits
- New Revenue (Google Maps)
- Reach and Retention (npr)
- Faster Partnerships (Kayak)
- Mobile and Omnichannel (Capital One, Facebook, Amazon, mobile apps)
- Interaction Analysis (Mastercard)
- Outsourced Innovation (Netflix)
- Self-Service Integration (Amazon)
- Organizational Agility ("API First")

## Digital Feedback Loop
Business Goals -> Digital Reach -> Business Results -> Data-drive Insights -> Business Goals

## Case Studies
### Amazon
>Amazon's devleopment of APIs in 2001-2002 connected the Amazon organization via web services. With good API documentation, the use of APIs in Amazon allowed for expansion towards infrastructure provisioning services--going from book retailer to AWS. Seamless switching from website to mobile.

### Disney
>Disney's use of a band is an IoT device that enabled an Omnichannel method to access keys, rides, etc. This allowed not only widespread usage, but also data-drive approaches to problems.

### Summary:
Define APIs. Understand Digital Feedback Loop. Business benefits, and API value in real life.
