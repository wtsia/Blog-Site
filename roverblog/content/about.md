Since the age of 10, I've been an avid computer user, learning how to mount ISOs, and participating in peer-to-peer networks. My first encounter with the art of computer programming was during a class where I would learn about programming in C++. Since then, I've developed an avid interest in building software tools, with a specific interest in software engineering, databases, and information security.

Computing is not only scalable, but the way forward as human society tackles more complex problems, from big data and automation to assisting human tasks and even exploration.
