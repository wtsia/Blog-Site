Since the age of 10, I've had an avid interest in computers. At the time, you'd find me doing anything from learning basic coding, tinkering with HTML/CSS, mounting ISOs, building PCs, running local gaming servers, and participating in peer-to-peer networks up to high school. 

My first encounter with the art of computer programming was during a class where I would learn about programming in C++. Since then, I've developed an avid interest in building software, with a specific interest in software engineering, databases, and information security.
