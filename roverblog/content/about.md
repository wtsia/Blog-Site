Since the age of 10, I've been an avid computer user, learning how to mount ISOs, and participating in peer-to-peer networks. My first encounter with the art of computer programming was during a class where I would learn about programming in C++. Since then, I've developed an avid interest in building software tools, with a specific interest in software engineering, databases, and information security. 

Current Topic Priorities:
- C++, Golang, MySQL
